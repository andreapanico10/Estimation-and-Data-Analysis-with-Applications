<h1>Problem Statement</h1> 

Estimation of the positioning of a mobile robot based on relative distance and / or orientation information
from one or more landmarks with different acquisition frequencies. 'Earth' surface environment

State vector definition:
𝑥 𝑿 = $𝑦(
𝜃
Where 𝑥 and 𝑦 are the Cartesian coordinates and 𝜃 is the angle formed between the direction of the robot and the x axis.
The motion of the robot can be described in a sufficiently accurate way by the time-continuous dynamic model:
𝑥̇ = 𝑣cos(𝜃) )𝑦̇ = 𝑣sin(𝜃)
𝜃̇ = 𝜔
